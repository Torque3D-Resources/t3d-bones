# t3d-bones

A truly skeletal starter/learning project for [Torque 3D][].

## About

`t3d-bones` provides an almost completely minimal example of how to start the T3D engine, load a level and create a camera to view it through.
Oh, and the console is still there, but removing it is as simple as removing one line of code.

## How to get started

Want to start your own project based off `t3d-bones`?
Awesome!
To get started, just clone this repository somewhere:

    git clone git@github.com:eightyeight/t3d-bones.git myAwesomeGame

And then delete the `.git` folder that links your repository to mine:

    rm -rf myAwesomeGame/.git

In the interests of keeping the repository small and focused on the scripts, there are no binary files included.
You can either copy them from your main T3D installation, or download [Empty.dll][] and [Empty.exe][] from my DropBox account.
And you're ready to go!

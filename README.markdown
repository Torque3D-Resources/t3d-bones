# t3d-bones

A truly skeletal starter/learning project for [Torque 3D][].

## About

`t3d-bones` provides an almost completely minimal example of how to start the T3D engine, load a level and create a camera to view it through.
Oh, and the console is still there, but removing it is as simple as removing one line of code.

## How to get started

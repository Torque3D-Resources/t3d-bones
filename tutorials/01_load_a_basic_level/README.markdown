# Load a basic level

This tutorial covers the very basics of creating objects in a level once the engine has started up.
This includes datablocks, materials, and as a bonus, key binds.
It's pretty much based on the contents of the default [`game/main.cs`][main.cs], so if you're comfortable with all that code, you might want to skip ahead.

 [main.cs]: ../../game/main.cs
